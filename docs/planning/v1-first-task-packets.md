# v1 — First Task-Packet DAG (bootstrap dry-run)

> A concrete application of `DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md` (D1–D8) to `SPEC.md` §10. Covers Milestone 0 (foundation) and Milestone 1 (Agent⇄Edge transport + enrollment). Later milestones continue in the same shape. Because the repo is greenfield, every packet's context bundle currently resolves to the ADRs / `CONTEXT.md` / `SPEC.md` (the only existing context) plus the crates produced by earlier packets.

## Dependency DAG

```
P0.1 workspace+CI+docker
      │
P0.2 common wire-types crate
      ├────────────┬────────────┐
P1.1 Edge QUIC   P1.2 Agent    P1.3 join-token
     listener      dialer+FB     enrollment
                                    │
                                 P1.4 short-lived mTLS auth (Agent→Edge)
```

Independent after P0.2: **P1.1, P1.2, P1.3** run in parallel. **P1.4** waits on P1.3. Edge↔Agent end-to-end auth demo waits on P1.1+P1.4.

---

## P0.1 — Rust workspace + CI + dev docker image

- **Goal:** a buildable Cargo workspace with empty `agent`, `edge`, `control-plane`, `common` crates; CI runs build+test+lint+`cargo audit`; a hermetic dev/CI docker image.
- **Acceptance tests:** `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test --workspace` green; CI workflow green on the empty tree; `docker build` of the dev image succeeds and runs the test suite.
- **Allowed surface:** `Cargo.toml`, `crates/*/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or local CI runner), `Dockerfile.dev`.
- **Context bundle:** ADR-0007 (Rust), DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS D3/D7 (docker/CI substrate). No prior code.
- **Fits budget:** trivially. **Prereq of everything.**

## P0.2 — `common` wire-types crate

- **Goal:** shared, logic-free types: `TenantId`, `AgentId`, `RoutingToken`, `OriginIdentity` (pubkey), `Capability`, message framing enums. serde-serializable.
- **Acceptance tests:** types compile; serde round-trip property tests for every type; no dependency on `agent`/`edge`.
- **Allowed surface:** `crates/common/`.
- **Context bundle:** `CONTEXT.md` (Routing Token, Origin Identity, Capability, Tenant, Agent Identity); ADR-0013/0014. Depends on P0.1.
- **Fits budget:** yes.

## P1.1 — Edge QUIC listener (relay-less echo)

> **Decomposed (cycle 3):** exceeded a single Haiku-sized pass (quinn + async runtime + TLS cert plumbing + connection + echo + integration test). Split into:
> - **P1.1a** — QUIC/TLS plumbing: server `Endpoint` with self-signed cert binds an ephemeral port. Isolates dependency + crypto-provider risk.
> - **P1.1b** — connect + bidirectional echo stream (integration test, client↔server).
> - **P1.1c** — reject malformed/untrusted handshake.

- **Goal:** Edge accepts QUIC/UDP-443 connections (quinn), opens per-stream handling, echoes a stream (transport correctness before routing).
- **Acceptance tests:** integration test — a QUIC client connects, opens a stream, bytes echo back; malformed handshake rejected.
- **Allowed surface:** `crates/edge/` (transport module only).
- **Context bundle:** ADR-0004 (QUIC), `common` framing (P0.2). Depends on P0.2.
- **Fits budget:** yes (single module + one integration test).

## P1.2 — Agent QUIC dialer + TCP fallback detection

> **Decomposed (cycle 6):** split into P1.2a (transport-selection decision + QUIC dialer + interop test), P1.2b (reconnect-on-drop with backoff), P1.2c (actual HTTP/2-over-TCP fallback transport). P1.2a done; b/c are follow-ups (P1.3 enrollment prioritised next for the Milestone-1 critical path).

- **Goal:** Agent dials outbound QUIC to a given Edge address; detects blocked UDP and selects HTTP/2-over-TCP fallback.
- **Acceptance tests:** Agent connects to a P1.1 test Edge; unit test forces UDP-blocked and asserts fallback selection; reconnect on drop.
- **Allowed surface:** `crates/agent/` (transport module only).
- **Context bundle:** ADR-0004, `common` (P0.2). Depends on P0.2 (test-integrates with P1.1 but does not import it).
- **Fits budget:** yes.

## P1.3 — Join-token enrollment

> **Decomposed (cycle 7):** P1.3a (control-plane in-memory enrollment service: issue single-use token, redeem binds Agent public key to Tenant, reject reuse/unknown) — done. P1.3b (Agent ed25519 identity keypair + enroll interop, private key never leaves Agent) — next.

- **Goal:** control-plane endpoint issues a single-use join token; Agent redeems it, generates an identity keypair, and binds its public key to the Tenant.
- **Acceptance tests:** enroll flow test (issue → redeem → bound); single-use enforced (second redeem rejected); keypair never leaves the Agent (asserted by interface).
- **Allowed surface:** `crates/control-plane/` (enrollment module), `crates/agent/` (enroll module).
- **Context bundle:** ADR-0005 (asymmetric identity), `common` (P0.2). Depends on P0.2.
- **Fits budget:** yes.

## P1.4 — Short-lived mTLS credential + Agent→Edge auth

> **Decomposed (cycle 9, refined cycle 10):** P1.4a (credential primitive — issuer-signed, expiry-bounded `Credential`; `mint`/`verify`) ✅ · P1.4b (enrollment-gated minting — only bound identities) ✅ · P1.4c (credential types + `verify` extracted to `ct-common`; Edge-side verification in `ct-edge::auth`) ✅ · P1.4d-i (credential binary wire encode/decode — serde can't derive `[u8;64]`) ✅ · P1.4d-ii (present the credential over the QUIC handshake: Agent presents, Edge verifies). Note: implemented as an ed25519 issuer-signed credential (same CA-signed/short-lived/verifiable trust structure as mTLS); real X.509 client-cert mTLS is a later hardening.

- **Goal:** control-plane mints a short-lived mTLS credential from the bound identity; Agent authenticates to the Edge with it.
- **Acceptance tests:** Agent with a valid fresh credential authenticates to Edge; expired/rotated credential rejected; hostname/tenant scoping enforced.
- **Allowed surface:** `crates/control-plane/` (minting), `crates/edge/` (auth), `crates/agent/` (auth).
- **Context bundle:** ADR-0005, P1.1 (Edge transport), P1.3 (bound identity). Depends on **P1.3** (and integrates with P1.1).
- **Fits budget:** borderline — if the bundle (mint + edge-auth + agent-auth across three crates) exceeds budget at grading time, D1 says **decompose** (e.g. split minting from verification).

## Milestone 2 — Tunnel Registry + Rendezvous (SPEC §10 item 2)

Relay path first (correctness before NAT traversal), per ADR-0006 / ADR-0015.

### P2.1 — Tunnel Registry (in-memory)
- **Goal:** control-plane registry mapping `RoutingToken` → `TunnelInfo` (tenant, agent); `register` / `lookup` / `unregister`.
- **Acceptance:** register→lookup; unknown→None; unregister removes; re-register overwrites.
- **Surface:** `crates/control-plane/src/registry.rs`. **Context:** ADR-0006, ADR-0017, CONTEXT (Tunnel Registry, Routing Token).

### P2.2 — Agent registers a tunnel
- Agent mints a `Capability` (Routing Token + Origin Identity) and registers the token → tunnel in the registry.

### P2.3 — Rendezvous (relay path)
> **Decomposed (cycle 16):** P2.3a (token-resolution handshake — Client presents a Routing Token, Edge resolves via an `is_known` predicate over the registry, replies OK/NO) · P2.3b (byte relay, folded into P2.4).
- Client presents a Routing Token to the Edge; the Edge looks up the registry and relays between Client and Agent (relay-first; NAT hole-punching is a later packet).

### P2.4 — Relay data path
> **Decomposed (cycle 17):** P2.4a (generic provider-blind bidirectional relay primitive via `copy_bidirectional`, tested with in-memory duplex) · P2.4b (wire the relay onto paired QUIC streams: Client stream ↔ Agent tunnel).
- Edge relays opaque ciphertext bytes between the Client stream and the Agent tunnel (provider-blind).

## Milestone 3 — Noise Client↔Origin E2E (SPEC §10 item 3)

Provider-blind E2E via the Noise Protocol Framework (ADR-0013): Noise_IK, static X25519 keys, Client pins the Origin Identity.

### P3.1 — Noise static keypair + Origin Identity
- **Goal:** generate a Noise static X25519 keypair (via `snow`); its public half is the Origin Identity.
- **Surface:** `crates/common/src/noise.rs`. **Context:** ADR-0013, CONTEXT (Origin Identity).

### P3.2 — Noise handshake (Client↔Origin)
- Complete a Noise_IK handshake between two parties; derive transport keys; encrypt/decrypt a message end to end.

### P3.3 — Noise session over QUIC (through the relay)
> **Decomposed (cycle 21):** P3.3a (message framing codec — 2-byte length prefix, since Noise messages are variable-length) · P3.3b (drive the Noise handshake + transport through the relay/QUIC; prove the Edge sees only ciphertext).
- Run the Noise session inside the QUIC stream so the Edge relays only ciphertext (provider-blind).

### P3.4 — Capability import (Client)
- Client parses a `Capability`, pins the Origin Identity, and uses it as the handshake's remote static key.

## Milestone 4 — PoW-gated rendezvous (SPEC §10 item 5, ADR-0018)

Proof-of-work gates expensive Edge operations against floods/sybil (the deferred sybil-resistance lever). **NAT hole-punching (SPEC §10 item 4) is deferred** — it needs real network topology and isn't hermetically testable in the build container; noted, not silently skipped.

### P4.1 — PoW challenge/solve/verify primitive
- **Goal:** SHA-256 leading-zero-bits PoW. `Challenge { nonce, difficulty }`; `solve` finds a solution; `verify` checks cheaply.
- **Surface:** `crates/common/src/pow.rs` (sha2). **Context:** ADR-0018.

### P4.2 — Gate rendezvous behind PoW
> **Decomposed (cycle 25):** P4.2a (`ct-common::pow::build_request`/`check_request` — solve+pack, verify+unpack the gated request) · P4.2b (wire into the QUIC rendezvous: Edge issues a Challenge, Client solves, Edge checks before resolving the token).
- `resolve_rendezvous` requires a valid PoW solution before resolving a token.

### P4.3 — Per-token rate limiting
- Rate-limit rendezvous per Routing Token / identity.

## Notes for the run

- **Readiness gate (D2):** each packet's acceptance tests + stubs must resolve against its bundle before a Haiku agent is assigned; P1.4 is the first likely **decompose** candidate.
- **Escalation (D6/HITL):** nothing here should hit an unsourceable gap — all context exists in the ADRs. The first genuine escalations are more likely in Milestone 5 (billing/PoW) where the backlog risks (jurisdiction, billing-sybil) are unresolved.
- **Frozen tests (D4):** the acceptance tests above are authored by the strong model and are immutable to the executing Haiku.
