# Install & use

Easy-going setup. Everything runs in containers, so the only hard requirement is
**Docker** (plus `git`). No Rust toolchain needs to be installed on the host.

## 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scimbe/claude-tunnel.git
cd claude-tunnel
```

## 2. Build & test (hermetic — no host toolchain)

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work rust:1-slim \
  sh -c 'cargo build --workspace && cargo test --workspace'
```

That builds all five crates and runs the full test suite in a throwaway
container.

## 3. Run it

### Self-host (Docker Compose) — one file, durable state

```bash
cp docker/deploy/.env.example docker/deploy/.env   # edit ports / OIDC issuer / webhook secret
docker compose -f docker/deploy/compose.selfhost.yml --env-file docker/deploy/.env up --build -d
```

The control plane persists to a named volume and restarts on failure; the edge
comes up once the control plane is healthy.

> **Build caching (needs BuildKit/buildx).** The image (`docker/Dockerfile`) uses
> BuildKit cache mounts for the cargo registry and `target/`, so an incremental
> rebuild after a small change takes ~20 s instead of recompiling the whole
> dependency tree (5–20 min). This needs BuildKit — modern `docker` enables it by
> default; otherwise export `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` or install the `docker-buildx`
> plugin. The **legacy builder silently ignores** `--mount=type=cache` (you'll see
> a "legacy builder is deprecated" warning and rebuilds stay cold).

### Hosted (Kubernetes)

```bash
kubectl kustomize docker/deploy/k8s     # review the rendered manifests
kubectl apply -k docker/deploy/k8s      # namespace ct-system: control plane + edge + TLS ingress
```

## 4. Onboard an agent (one command)

With a control-plane URL and a single-use join token:

```bash
CT_AGENT_CP_URL="$CP_URL" \
CT_AGENT_JOIN_TOKEN="<token>" \
CT_AGENT_ID="agent-1" \
CT_AGENT_EDGE="edge.example.com:4433" \
CT_AGENT_ORIGIN="127.0.0.1:8080" \
  ct-agent onboard
```

## Helper scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `scripts/security-audit.sh` | `cargo audit` against the pinned `Cargo.lock` in a container |
| `scripts/check-no-secrets.sh` | guard that no credential material is committed |
| `scripts/sweep.sh` | run the latency benchmark matrix (edge netem × modes) |
| `scripts/plot.sh`, `scripts/tabulate.py` | turn benchmark output into figures / tables |
| `scripts/thesis-haw-build.sh` | build the thesis PDF in a TeX Live container |
| `scripts/claude-resume.sh` | development session helper |

## Configuration reference

Environment variables, monitoring endpoints, rotation and incident procedures are
in the [operations runbook](ops/runbook.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **`/readyz` returns 503** — the control plane can't reach its database; check the
  data volume mount.
- **Webhooks return 401** — `CT_PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` doesn't match the provider.
- **`/me/*` returns 404** — OIDC isn't configured; set `CT_OIDC_ISSUER` (the realm
  JWKS is fetched at startup; `CT_OIDC_PUBKEY_PATH` is an optional offline override).
