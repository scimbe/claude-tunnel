# Agent onboarding — quickstart

Bring a tunnel agent online in **one command**. The operator handles a single
secret (a single-use join token); the agent generates its own identity, enrolls
itself, and starts tunnelling. The private key never leaves the agent, and the
data path stays end-to-end encrypted (Noise) — the operator can route your
traffic but cannot read it.

## What you need

- The **control-plane URL** (from the hosted portal, or your self-hosted
  deployment — e.g. `https://cp.example.com`).
- A **tenant** name you enroll under.
- The `ct-agent` binary (or the `ct-testbed` image that ships it).
- The address of the **edge** to dial and the **local origin** service you want
  to expose.

## Step 1 — issue a single-use join token (operator / portal)

The portal does this for you. To do it by hand, ask the control plane to mint a
token for your tenant:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$CP_URL/enroll/issue" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tenant":"my-tenant"}'
# => {"token":"<64 hex chars>"}
```

The token is **single-use**: it enrolls exactly one agent and cannot be reused.

## Step 2 — onboard the agent (one command)

Point the agent at the control plane and hand it the token. It generates a fresh
identity, redeems the token (binding its public key to your tenant), and serves
the tunnel:

```bash
CT_AGENT_CP_URL="$CP_URL" \
CT_AGENT_JOIN_TOKEN="<token from step 1>" \
CT_AGENT_ID="agent-1" \
CT_AGENT_EDGE="edge.example.com:4433" \
CT_AGENT_ORIGIN="127.0.0.1:8080" \
  ct-agent onboard
# => ct-agent: onboarded agent=agent-1 tenant=my-tenant via https://cp.example.com (edge=...)
```

That's it — install → enroll → tunnel in a single step. Setting
`CT_AGENT_JOIN_TOKEN` alone also triggers onboarding, so the explicit `onboard`
argument is optional.

## Optional knobs

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CT_AGENT_ORIGIN_PROTO` | `tcp` | Origin transport (`tcp` or `udp`). |
| `CT_AGENT_DIRECT_ADVERTISE` | unset | IP to advertise for a direct P2P path (bypasses the relay). |
| `CT_AGENT_METRICS_LISTEN` | unset | Address to serve Prometheus `/metrics` on. |
| `CT_AGENT_EDGE_CERT` | `/shared/edge-cert.der` | Path to the edge CA certificate. |
| `CT_AGENT_FALLBACK_443` | `false` | If the configured edge port is blocked, also try the edge's unified `:443` front door (TLS-TCP, `ALPN=ct-edge`) (#46). |
| `CT_AGENT_RECONNECT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `10` | Reconnect attempts before the agent exits; `0` = retry forever (for long-lived deployments that must rejoin a redeployed edge) (#36). |
| `CT_AGENT_STATE_DIR` | unset | Persist the bound identity/tenant to this directory after the first onboard, so a container restart **restores** it instead of re-redeeming the (now-spent) single-use join token (#141). Point it at a durable volume for restart-safe deployments; unset ⇒ every boot redeems again. |

`CT_AGENT_EDGE` and `CT_AGENT_ORIGIN` accept either `IP:port` or `host:port` — a
hostname (e.g. a Compose service name) is resolved via DNS (#45).

## What just happened

1. The agent generated an ed25519 identity locally — only the **public** key was
   sent to the control plane.
2. It redeemed the join token, which **bound that public key to your tenant**.
   The token is now spent.
3. It began serving your origin through the tunnel; payload bytes are encrypted
   end-to-end, so the edge and control plane only ever see ciphertext.
