//! #147-L4 — dedicated settlement chain for LLM-token payments.
//!
//! A minimal **hash-linked, signature-verified, append-only ledger** — the "real chain" the maintainer
//! green-lit (#147 req 3), explicitly distinct from the *symbolic* `SettleReceipt`/`BillingCommitment`
//! family in [`crate::channel`]. This is the **L4.1 foundation**: block linkage, ed25519-signed
//! transfers, balances with no overdraft, and per-sender replay nonces — the integrity core a
//! settlement currency needs. It is deliberately **single-writer** (no consensus yet) and in-memory:
//!
//! NOT in this slice (explicit follows): consensus / Byzantine agreement across writers, P2P gossip of
//! blocks, and the marketplace integration — the auction (#147-L2) that decides *what* transfers to
//! settle, and the consumption-proof (#147-L3) that gates *when* a credit finalizes. This layer only
//! guarantees that, given a set of transfers, the resulting ledger is tamper-evident and conserves
//! value (no forgery, no double-spend, no overdraft).
//!
//! Accounts are ed25519 holder public keys — the same key family used everywhere else — so an agent's
//! settlement account is its identity, and a transfer is authorized only by the holder's own signature.
