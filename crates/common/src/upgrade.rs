//! Opportunistic relay→direct upgrade coordination for A2A channels (#104).
//!
//! When two channel members can't reach each other directly they fall back to the
//! edge relay (`AF4-relay-clientwire`), which then carries the full ciphertext path
//! for the session's lifetime — even if a direct path later becomes viable (NAT
//! rebinds, a firewall opens, peers roam). This module is the pure, deterministic
//! **coordination + accounting** core of promoting such a session back to direct and
//! freeing the relay — the Tailscale DERP→direct shape.
//!
//! Two pieces, both mesh-independent and unit-testable (the live QUIC re-dial + stream
//! handover is a follow packet):
//!
//! * [`UpgradeCoordinator`] — decides **when** and **who**: only the initiator side
//!   owns triggering the swap (so both peers don't race), retries a background direct
//!   dial on a backoff while still relayed, and records the handover (with the
//!   time-to-upgrade metric) once a direct path is confirmed.
//! * [`PathMeter`] — per-session byte accounting (relay vs direct) so the offload goal
//!   is *measurable*, not just asserted.
//!
//! Time is caller-supplied (`now`, unix seconds) for deterministic tests, mirroring
//! [`crate::replay`] and [`crate::ratelimit`].
