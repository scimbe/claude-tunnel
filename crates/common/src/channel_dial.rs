//! Agent-bridges-v2: the native-only channel **dialer policy** for a server-side caller
//! (`ct-control-plane`'s bridge dialer): reach the customer's agent through this
//! deployment's own broker/relay pair over QUIC, present a grant, complete the Noise_IK
//! handshake, send exactly one JSON-RPC `tools/call`, read the reply, disconnect.
//!
//! **This module no longer implements the wire protocol.** Phase 2 of the CADS-Tunnel/
//! ct-agent consolidation moved the channel join protocol's client half into this crate as
//! its normative home — [`crate::channel_wire`] (outcome type, ack parser, refusal-category
//! decoder, park-expiry classifier; `channel_wire::io` for the stream-generic admission
//! exchange) and [`crate::channel_quic`] (the accept-any-cert channel dialer) — a verbatim
//! port of ct-agent's `channel.rs`/`transport.rs` with its whole fix history (ct-agent#21
//! #23 #28 #36 #129 #140 #148, CADS-Tunnel#494 #495 #500 #506 #524 #557) and the guard
//! tests. Before that this module carried its own narrower copy of the same exchange; two
//! copies that each agreed with themselves could drift apart unnoticed (they already had,
//! in the reflexive/`r=` handling and the post-possession refusal category). What is left
//! here is only what a BRIDGE caller adds on top of the shared protocol:
//!
//! - the two-hop dial sequence and its per-phase budgets (#745, below),
//! - [`DialError`], the typed outcome the control-plane route handler and the portal's
//!   result page (which renders its `Display`) react to, and the ONE adapter
//!   ([`present_join`]) that maps the shared exchange's outcomes and `BoxError`s onto it,
//! - the ct-agent#101 trust gate [`reject_unverified_peer`] between "the broker paired us
//!   with someone" and "we run a Noise handshake with them".
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT implement the direct-address path, the `:443` front-door
//! fallback, or DCUtR — a bridge caller always talks to this deployment's own trusted
//! broker over its dedicated QUIC ports, none of that generality applies.
//!
//! **Two hops, two QUIC connections (#745).** A bridge caller is itself relay-only (it
//! advertises [`CHANNEL_ENDPOINT_RELAY_ONLY`]) and the customer's agent it dials is, in
//! the scenario this exists for, relay-only too (`CT_CHANNEL_RELAY_ONLY=1`). ct-agent's
//! own relay-only initiator (`channel_run/mod.rs::run_channel_join_with_admission` →
//! `join_via_relay`) therefore does exactly this, and so does [`dial_and_call`]:
//!
//! 1. **Rendezvous hop** — a QUIC connection to the broker (`:4435`), one admission
//!    bi-stream, `[0xFF, 0x01]` phase preamble + the join, possession challenge/signature,
//!    the EOF-terminated `OK …` ack carrying the PEER's attested Noise key/holder/attestation.
//!    That triple is verified (ct-agent#101) and kept; the connection is then dropped — the
//!    rendezvous port's contract is ack-and-close, nothing else is ever read or written on it.
//! 2. **Relay hop** — a SEPARATE QUIC connection to the relay (`:4436`), dialed only AFTER
//!    hop 1 acked (ct-agent#103: a relay connection held idle through hop 1 gets reaped as
//!    a spurious `[quic-bistream]` drop), one throwaway admission bi-stream with the SAME
//!    join request and the `[0xFF, 0x02]` preamble, the same challenge/signature/ack
//!    procedure (the relay ack's peer material is not authoritative — hop 1's is, as in
//!    ct-agent). Then a FRESH `open_bi()` on that relay connection is the session stream:
//!    the edge splices the initiator's NEXT bi-stream to the acceptor
//!    (`ct_edge::relay::relay_initiator_to_acceptor`), so the Noise_IK handshake and the
//!    encrypted `tools/call` run there — never on the admission stream, which was
//!    `finish()`ed after the signature and which the edge never reads session bytes from.
//!
//! Before #745 this module performed hop 1 only and then ran Noise on the already-finished
//! admission stream, so the relay-only acceptor parked on `:4436` reaped with "park expired
//! with no partner (#21)" on every call.
//!
//! Everything below the admission (the Noise_IK handshake, the encrypted send/recv, the
//! JSON-RPC request encoding) reuses this crate's own [`crate::a2a`]/[`crate::mcp`].
//!
//! `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`-gated: this crate is also compiled for the browser
//! channel-claim page (wasm32-unknown-unknown), which has no `quinn`/`rustls`/`tokio::net` —
//! see this crate's `Cargo.toml` for the matching `[target.'cfg(not(target_arch =
//! "wasm32"))'.dependencies]` block. A native build (ct-control-plane, ct-agent) sees this
//! module; a wasm32 build does not, and nothing here can ever be reached from one.
