//! Agent Fabric — channel addressing and trust-chain grants (ADR-0020, #72).
//!
//! A **Channel** is an opaque agent-to-agent rendezvous point one agent operates
//! and others join; it is addressed by a [`ChannelId`] (no hostname, operator-blind
//! — the same shape as a `RoutingToken`). A **[`ChannelGrant`]** is the trust-chain
//! primitive: a *scoped, directional, expiring* authorization minted by a channel
//! operator for a member — deliberately unlike a flat bearer token where possession
//! equals full access. This module holds the claims, the wire form, and stateless
//! verification; the operator's signing key lives with the operator, mirroring the
//! issuer model of [`crate::credential`]. Time is caller-supplied so it stays
//! deterministic and wall-clock-free.
//!
//! AF2a lands only these primitives (types + sign/verify + wire). The rendezvous
//! transport, the control-plane channel/invitation registry, and connect-time
//! enforcement of the `holder` binding come in later sub-packets (AF2b/AF3/AF4).
