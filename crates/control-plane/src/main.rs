//! Configuration: `CT_CONTROL_PLANE_LISTEN` (default `0.0.0.0:8090`),
//! `CT_CONTROL_PLANE_DB` (default `control-plane.db`),
//! `CT_PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (the payment provider's webhook signing secret;

//! effectively disabled until a real secret is configured), `CT_PORTAL_SESSION_KEY`
//! (#294: the portal session cookie's HMAC key — a **distinct** secret from the
//! webhook one, since that one is shared with an external payment provider; if

//! it's set), and `CT_OIDC_ISSUER` + `CT_OIDC_PUBKEY_PATH` (the Keycloak realm
//! issuer and a PEM file with the realm's RSA public key; when both are set the
//! authenticated `/me/*` endpoints are mounted, otherwise they are absent), and
//! `CT_ADMIN_SUPER_EMAIL` (ADR-0025 — the one Google account allowed to reach
//! the admin console and manage other admins; **required**, no default: this
//! process refuses to start without it, same fail-closed posture as
//! `CT_EDGE_ADMIN_TOKEN`), and `CT_BRIDGE_HOLDER_KEY` + `CT_BRIDGE_NOISE_KEY`
//! (Agent-bridges-v2 — the shared identity this deployment dials the
//! platform's own channel broker with, on a tunnel owner's behalf, from the
//! portal's "Agent bridges" page; 64 hex chars each, **optional** -- unlike
//! `CT_ADMIN_SUPER_EMAIL`/`CT_EDGE_ADMIN_TOKEN`, this degrades gracefully
//! (same posture as `edge_admin`/`CT_CP_EDGE_ADMIN_URL`): if unset or
//! malformed, the dialer is simply disabled and the two Agent-bridges portal
//! routes 503 clearly, rather than the whole process refusing to boot for a
//! brand-new, non-essential feature) plus the optional `CT_CHANNEL_BROKER`
//! (host:port of that broker; defaults to this deployment's own production
//! broker address if unset -- not a secret either).
