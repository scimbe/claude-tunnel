//! Rot/Gelb/Grün certificate-tier admission broker (#233): the control-plane
//! half of moving thousands of new customers/day past Let's Encrypt's
//! 50-certificates-per-registered-domain-per-7-days ceiling without ever
//! sharing an agent's TLS private key.
//!
//! `ct-agent` cannot become a thin ACME client driven by this crate — Cargo
//! forbids the cycle (`ct-agent` already depends on `ct-control-plane`). So
//! this module is deliberately **not** an ACME client: it is an admission
//! gate, a CA-assignment ledger, and a self-throttled rate-limit budget
//! tracker. `ct-agent`'s own `acme_client`/`acme_orchestrate` keep driving
//! the real ACME wire protocol exactly as before; they just poll
//! [`admission`] first and report back via [`issuance_complete`].
//!
//! Every hostname starts **Rot** (created, not yet reachable), is promoted to
//! **Gelb** once it is live via the shared edge wildcard certificate (see the
//! `ct-edge` Gelb-termination path), and finally reaches **Grün** once its own
//! individually-issued, agent-held-key certificate exists. A Gelb hostname
//! sits in a FIFO queue; [`run_admission_loop`] periodically offers the
//! front-of-queue hostnames a 48h claim window against whichever CA in
//! [`ct_common::acme_ca::active_rotation`] currently has the most headroom —
//! a CA assignment, once offered, is **permanent** ([`SqliteTunnelStore::offer_claim`]/
//! [`SqliteTunnelStore::record_issuance_complete`] both refuse to rewrite an
//! already-set `assigned_ca`): every renewal reuses the same CA forever.
//!
//! Ownership is gated exactly like [`crate::dns01_challenge`]: an agent
//! proves it owns a hostname via the same routing token
//! [`crate::edge_mesh::SqliteEdgeMesh::token_owns_hostname`] already checks.
