//! CADS Tunnel Control Plane — thin, self-hostable-ready coordination:
//! enrollment, Tunnel Registry, Rendezvous, billing. Holds no Agent/CA private
//! keys and never sees payload — but is not trust-material-free (#266): it
//! holds the credential-issuer signing key ([`credential::CredentialIssuer`],
//! currently unwired, #260), per-CA EAB credentials ([`acme_broker`]), and any
//! configured DNS-provider token ([`dns01_challenge`]) — operator secrets that
//! need the same protection/rotation care as any other. See ADR-0005
//! (enrollment/identity), ADR-0017 (thin control plane).
