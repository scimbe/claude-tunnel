//! Multi-edge preparation (ADR-0021): a durable registry of which edge
//! instance currently serves which routing token / hostname, so the system
//! can add edge hosts without the tunnel-routing state living only in one
//! process's memory.
//!
//! Today there is exactly one edge, and this registry is a no-op fast path
//! (every tunnel is "assigned" to that one edge, every lookup resolves
//! locally). The value delivered *now*, with zero new infrastructure:
//!
//! - **Fixes the restart-wipes-host-auth bug.** `crates/edge/src/state.rs`'s
//!   `host_auth` map is purely in-process memory with no persistence — every
//!   edge container recreation silently drops every hostname authorization
//!   (this caused a real production outage this session, #214). Because the
//!   control plane already originates every hostname authorization (it mints
//!   the token and pushes `authorize-host` to the edge), it can durably
//!   record that fact here and hand it back to the edge on boot to replay.
//! - **Lays the real groundwork for horizontal scale.** Once a second edge
//!   exists, [`assign_edge`] starts round-robining new tunnels across every
//!   edge that's heartbeated recently, and any edge can look up which peer
//!   holds a token/hostname it doesn't have locally via `GET
//!   /internal/edges/lookup`.
//!
//! The edge-to-edge byte-relay itself (ADR-0021 Part 1) IS built on top of
//! that lookup — `crate::edge`'s `relay_via_peer_edge`/the `'M'`-framed
//! relay role in `serve.rs` — but stays off by default
//! (`CT_EDGE_MESH_RELAY_ENABLED`) until an operator actually runs a second
//! edge; with exactly one edge every local route always hits, so the relay
//! path is a no-op either way.
