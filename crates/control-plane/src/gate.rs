//! Browser-Plane login gate (#382-follow): let a tunnel owner protect their
//! public content behind a Keycloak login, restricted to a per-tunnel email
//! allow-list (`crate::storage::SqliteTunnelStore`'s `require_login`/
//! `tunnel_login_allowlist`). The tunnel owner toggles this and manages the
//! allow-list from the portal (see `portal_api.rs`'s tunnel-settings routes);
//! this module is the gate itself, sitting in front of the demo's own origin
//! via Caddy's `forward_auth` directive.
//!
//! Fully additive: a separate router, separate OIDC callback, and separate
//! session cookie from the existing customer portal login (`portal.rs`) --
//! zero changes to that already-tested path. Uses its **own** registered
//! redirect URI (`CT_GATE_REDIRECT_URI`, defaulting to swapping the portal's
//! own `/portal/callback` for `/gate/callback` when unset) -- this must be
//! added to the Keycloak client's `redirectUris` (`ct-demo-realm.json`, and
//! applied to an already-running realm via the Admin REST API, the exact
//! pattern `scripts/apply-realm-theme.sh` already uses for `accountTheme`).
//!
//! Flow: Caddy's `forward_auth` calls `GET /gate/check` for every request to a
//! gated hostname. No/invalid `ct_gate_session` cookie -> `401`, which Caddy's
//! `handle_errors` turns into a redirect to `GET /gate/start`. That mints a
//! CSRF state + a short-lived cookie recording which hostname/path the visitor
//! wanted, then sends them through the SAME Keycloak realm the portal uses.
//! `GET /gate/callback` verifies the CSRF state, exchanges the code, checks the
//! resulting email against that hostname's allow-list, and either mints a
//! `ct_gate_session` cookie (scoped to the parent domain via
//! `CT_GATE_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, so it's shared across every `*.<zone>` subdomain)
//! and redirects back to the original URL, or shows a clear "not on the access
//! list" page.
//!
//! Share links (#780): the tunnel owner can mint a time-boxed, optionally
//! single-use link from the portal (`portal_api/share.rs`). `GET /gate/share?
//! host=<gated hostname>&token=<token>` redeems it (`SqliteTunnelStore::
//! redeem_share_link`) and mints the SAME `ct_gate_session` cookie the OIDC
//! callback mints -- bound to that one hostname, with the synthetic subject
//! `share:<link id>` in the identity slot and the LINK's expiry as the session's
//! expiry (signed payload and cookie `Max-Age` alike, so a copied cookie dies
//! with the link). No account is involved. `gate_check` honors such a session
//! only for its own hostname, and additionally re-checks that the link is still
//! unrevoked and unexpired, so a revoke in the portal ends live sessions at once.
//! This covers every hostname the login gate covers (Gelb); a Grün/passthrough
//! hostname is never seen by this gate at all -- the agent-side counterpart is
//! ct-agent#185.
