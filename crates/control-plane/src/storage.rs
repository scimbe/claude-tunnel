//! SQLite-backed persistence (M18.1, productionization).
//!
//! Production requires durable state: the in-memory control-plane services lose
//! everything on restart. This module provides a SQLite-backed enrollment store
//! with the same semantics as [`crate::enrollment::Enrollment`], so it can
//! replace the in-memory version behind the HTTP layer. `rusqlite` with the
//! `bundled` SQLite (no system dependency) is called synchronously behind a
//! `Mutex`; the axum handlers already lock without holding the guard across an
//! `await`, so this fits the existing pattern.
//!
//! The store is deliberately backend-shaped (open / issue / redeem / binding) so
//! a Postgres backend for the hosted deployment can follow behind the same
//! surface.
//!
//! #344/#398: every `Sqlite*` store here still uses that single `Mutex<Connection>`
//! shape *except* [`SqliteTunnelStore`] (#344), [`SqliteAgentDirectory`],
//! [`SqlitePipelineRegistry`], [`SqliteChannelStore`] and [`SqliteTopologyStore`] (#398),
//! which also pool extra read-only connections via `r2d2`/`r2d2_sqlite` (see each store's own
//! struct doc for its specific read/write-contention reasoning). This is a deliberate,
//! per-store judgment call, not a uniform migration: #344 explicitly declined
//! [`SqliteEdgeMesh`] (its hot path is write-heavy, not read-heavy) rather than migrating it
//! just to hit a round number, and #398 re-verified that call plus made the same read/write
//! call-pattern judgment for every other store here. Migrated only where a real, hit,
//! read-heavy hot path justified it: `SqliteEnrollment`, `SqliteServiceAccountStore`,
//! `SqliteBootstrap`, `SqliteRegistry`, `SqliteLedger`, `SqliteNetworkStore` (all below) and
//! `SqliteEdgeMesh` (`edge_mesh.rs`) stay on the plain `Mutex<Connection>` shape -- see #398's
//! closing comment for the honest per-store reasoning on each.
