//! Edge admin API (#27 RB4) — an authenticated `POST /admin/revoke/:token` the
//! control plane calls when a customer revokes a tunnel. The edge then tears the
//! tunnel down and blocks its re-registration (see [`EdgeState::revoke_token`]).
//!
//! This is the HTTP counterpart of the QUIC `'R'` op (RB3b); the thin,
//! HTTP-based control plane calls it with `reqwest` rather than opening a QUIC
//! client. It is served on its own listener (`CT_EDGE_ADMIN_LISTEN`) so an
//! operator can bind it to a private interface, and every request must carry the
//! shared admin secret (`x-ct-admin-token`), checked in constant time.
