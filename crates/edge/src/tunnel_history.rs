//! #776: durable per-tunnel session history -- the foundation for owner-facing
//! uptime, usage, receipts, and alerts.
//!
//! [`EdgeState`](crate::state::EdgeState) keeps `tunnel_bytes`/`connected_since`/
//! `last_seen` in memory only: every redeploy wiped them, and the maps grew by one entry
//! per token ever seen with no eviction. This module adds the missing persistence: one
//! `tunnel_sessions` row per unbroken connection streak (opened by the first
//! registration on either transport, closed by the teardown paths), with the byte
//! counters flushed into the open row periodically and on close. The in-memory maps stay
//! the hot-path counters they are today -- `note_relay` never touches SQLite -- and the
//! flush task in [`run_tunnel_history_flush_loop`] is what finally lets them evict tokens
//! with no live session.
//!
//! Disclosure bound (ADR-0016 posture, same as the presence routes of #763): a session row
//! is METADATA ONLY -- routing token, transport, timestamps, a disconnect reason, and byte
//! volume. Never a hostname, source IP, request path, or any payload. The routing token is
//! stored as the same lowercase hex the admin API already uses for it.
//!
//! A separate DB file from `audit_log.rs`'s `conn_audit` (#603): that store is a host-only
//! evidentiary record with its own legal-floor retention argument; this one is served
//! over the admin listener to the control plane, so mixing the two in one file would blur
//! which access posture applies to which table. Same SQLite shape as `audit_log.rs`
//! (`open`/`open_in_memory`, a plain `Mutex<Connection>`, WAL + busy_timeout, owner-only
//! file mode), duplicated rather than shared for the same reason that file gives.
//!
//! Enabled by DEFAULT (unlike the audit log): the default path is `tunnel-history.sqlite`
//! beside the persisted CA key (`edge-ca-key.pem`, the edge's one durable volume);
//! `CT_EDGE_TUNNEL_HISTORY_PATH` overrides it and `CT_EDGE_TUNNEL_HISTORY=off` disables
//! it. A path that cannot be opened falls back to an in-memory store with a loud warning
//! -- the feature keeps working for the process lifetime, it just isn't durable.
//!
//! #782: the same store also holds the edge's **signed forensic receipts** -- a
//! `tunnel_receipts` table appended to, under the same connection lock, whenever a
//! session row is opened or closed and, hourly, when an open session's byte counters
//! moved. Each receipt is hash-chained to the previous one and ed25519-signed with the
//! edge's dedicated receipts key ([`crate::receipts`]); the chain head (last seq + hash)
//! lives in `tunnel_receipts_head` so retention pruning of old receipts never resets the
//! sequence. What a receipt proves, its exact JSON shape and the canonical form the
//! hash covers are documented once, on `ct_common::receipt`. Receipts are metadata only,
//! like the session rows they attest, and carry the routing token only as a SHA-256.
