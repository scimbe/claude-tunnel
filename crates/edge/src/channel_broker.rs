//! Agent Fabric — edge channel-pairing authorization (ADR-0020, #72 AF2b).
//!
//! The edge is the rendezvous gate for agent-to-agent channels: two agents that
//! want a direct channel each present a [`SignedChannelGrant`] for the same
//! [`ChannelId`], and the edge decides whether to broker them together. This module
//! is the **pure authorization + pairing core** (no sockets): it verifies both
//! grants against the channel operator's key, checks they are for the same channel
//! with compatible directions, and returns which side initiates and which accepts.
//! The socket-level QUIC brokering (generalising `rendezvous.rs` to relay between
//! two agents) and where the operator key comes from are later sub-packets.
//!
//! # `CT_EDGE_UNIFIED_PAIRER` (#591, #495 U2 slice 2)
//!
//! Two pairing paths exist: the QUIC-native one (`:4436` relay / `:4435` rendezvous,
//! [`run_channel_broker_loop`] over [`AdmittedMember`] + `finish_relay_pair` /
//! `finish_rendezvous_pair`) and the shared stream-generic one (`:443` TLS-TCP and the
//! WebSocket listener, one [`SharedChannelPairer`] over [`AdmittedStreamMember`] +
//! `finish_relay_pair_over_streams`). Members on different paths can never meet.
//! `CT_EDGE_UNIFIED_PAIRER=1` (only the literal `1`; default **off**) parks the `:4436`
//! RELAY loop's members in the shared pairer too, tagged [`SessionSource::QuicNextBiStream`]
//! so the shared completer keeps their wire contract per side: ack without newline, then
//! FIN on the admission stream, then the session on a FRESH bi-stream (initiator
//! `accept_bi`, acceptor `open_bi`) — while a `:443` partner is spliced on its own
//! admission stream. Off (or `1` without a front-door channel broker to route into) is the
//! QUIC-native path unchanged. The `:4435` rendezvous loop is never routed. Flipping this in
//! production is gated on a run with a REAL deployed ct-agent client against a flagged-on
//! edge, not on this module's unit tests: it changes which code path every fielded `:4436`
//! client is completed by, and the flag exists so that can be reverted instantly.
