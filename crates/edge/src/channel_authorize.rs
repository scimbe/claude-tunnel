//! Agent Fabric — edge-side channel-authorize resolver (#81 SEC81c-c c-ii).
//!
//! The live broker's admission gate needs `authorize(channel, holder) ->
//! Option<operator_pubkey>` — the operator key iff the holder is a current member — but
//! the channel registry lives in the control plane. This queries the CP's
//! `POST /internal/channel/authorize` (c-i), presenting the shared edge↔CP admin token,
//! and maps the response to `Option<[u8; 32]>`.
//!
//! It is **fail-closed on authoritative refusals**: a clean 404 (genuinely not a
//! member) or 401 (bad admin token) resolves to `None` and evicts any cached entry —
//! the CP has spoken, and it said no. It is **fail-*static* on transport-class
//! failures** (#231): a timeout, connection error, or malformed 2xx body falls back to
//! the last successful resolution for this `(channel, holder)`, if one is still within
//! [`CACHE_TTL`] — a CP blip mid-restart no longer refuses *every* presenting grant
//! plane-wide just because one lookup couldn't complete, which is what made a single
//! brief CP hiccup indistinguishable from "you were never a member" (#231: "any CP
//! blip refuses the whole plane"). A holder with no prior successful resolution still
//! fails closed on a transport error, exactly as before — this only lets an
//! *already-attested* membership ride out a brief CP restart, it never invents one.
//! `CACHE_TTL` is deliberately short (seconds) to bound how long a revoked member
//! could still ride a stale cache entry after a well-timed CP blip.
