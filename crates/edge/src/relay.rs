///     transmission is scheduled by quinn's background connection task, not
///     by the application calling flush. `shutdown()` calls `finish()`, which
///     only signals "no more data is coming" — previously written (already
///     buffered-in-quinn) data is still transmitted normally.
///   - `tokio_rustls::server::TlsStream`/`client::TlsStream` (the `:443`
///     TLS-TCP channel-relay fallback, tokio-rustls 0.26.4 / rustls 0.23.43):
///     `poll_write` itself already drains any produced TLS records to the
///     underlying socket in an inner loop (`while session.wants_write() {
///     write_io(cx) }`) before returning — rustls's `ConnectionCommon::write`
///     encrypts application data into ready-to-send records immediately, it
///     does not hold plaintext back awaiting a flush (that only happens
///     mid-handshake). The only way bytes can still be sitting unsent after a
///     `write_all` is if the socket briefly applied backpressure; even then,
///     `poll_shutdown` explicitly loops `while session.wants_write() {
///     write_io(cx) }` before closing the socket, so a skipped flush can never
///     strand data at EOF.
///   - `WsByteStream` (`ws_channel.rs`, the browser `/ws/channel` transport):
///     `poll_write` already calls `poll_flush` on the WebSocket sink inline,
///     before returning — there is never unflushed data left after a

///   agent->browser leg owns the [`FrameReader`] plus the browser write half,
///   and forwards what the writer-owner must know as [`FramedEvent`]s over a
///   bounded channel.
/// - **FIN semantics.** Browser EOF => in-band FIN toward the agent (the TCP
///   stream stays open both ways so keepalives can protect the reply's silent
///   tail). Peer FIN => shutdown toward the browser, relay continues (trailing
///   keepalives stay legal). The clean-EOF **implicit FIN** (an agent ending via
///   TLS close_notify instead of an explicit FIN frame) lands on the same path:
///   the reader leg finishes, the writer leg keeps pumping browser->agent until
///   its own natural end. **Termination is this caller's duty**: once FIN has
///   passed in BOTH directions the writer-owner calls [`FrameWriter::shutdown`]
///   (TLS close_notify, not an abrupt drop) and the relay returns promptly.
/// - **Liveness.** Injected counters are tracked in the codec's
///   [`KeepaliveTracker`] (cumulative acks); the relay fails `TimedOut` when
///   the oldest outstanding exceeds [`FRAMED_KEEPALIVE_DEAD_AFTER_MS`] (24s).
///   Liveness ends at the peer's FIN (tracker discarded -- a peer is not
///   ACK-obliged after its own FIN, so a verdict then would be a guaranteed
///   false positive); injection does NOT end -- post-peer-FIN keepalives keep
///   flowing untracked as pure middlebox state refresh for the still-open
///   sending direction, until FIN has passed both ways (codec contract, #528
///   review I3). The post-peer-FIN phase itself is bounded by
///   [`POST_PEER_FIN_IDLE_BOUND`] (codec contract, #528 review N2): once no
///   browser DATA has been written for that long after the peer's FIN, the
///   relay FINs its own direction and terminates cleanly -- without it, the
///   untracked injection would hold a data-idle half-closed relay open forever
///   (the keepalives reset the TCP idle timer and keep earning transport-level
///   ACKs, so neither the kernel keepalive nor retransmit escalation ever
///   fires). DATA progress resets the clock, so a legitimate long upload past
///   an early-FINning origin is never cut. Peer keepalives are ACKed iff the reader's own `should_ack`
///   verdict says so and are never forwarded -- a keepalive must not corrupt
///   the raw browser stream.
/// - **DATA flushing** applies the #338 short-read heuristic on both legs: the
///   agent-bound writer flushes after a short browser read (a likely message
///   boundary the far side waits on), full-buffer chunks coalesce; the codec
///   flushes KA/ACK/FIN inline itself. The browser leg flushes per chunk, since
///   each DATA frame is already a peer-chosen chunk.
