//! DNS-01 provider abstraction (#31 AD5): publish/clear `_acme-challenge` TXT
//! records for an ACME client, over one of three interchangeable backends —
//!
//! - [`Dns01Provider::SelfHosted`]: the in-process `ct-dns` store (AD1–AD3), for a
//!   fully self-contained deployment;
//! - [`Dns01Provider::Desec`]: **deSEC** (<https://desec.io>), a free managed DNS
//!   with a REST API — the alternative when you'd rather not run your own `:53`.
//!   **Operator-side only** (holds the zone-wide token);
//! - [`Dns01Provider::RemoteAgent`] (ADR-0003 follow-up): the variant an
//!   **agent** actually uses — proves hostname ownership to the control
//!   plane's `/agent/dns01-challenge` endpoint with its own routing token, so
//!   the zone-wide DNS credential never leaves the operator's control plane.
//!
//! All three stay available; the operator selects a server-side one (see
//! `docs/dns01-desec.md` and the `.env`), agents always use `RemoteAgent`. The
//! deSEC token is read from the environment at startup and never logged.
