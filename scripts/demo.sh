# Human demo (issue #7) — SHOW the tunnel working, don't just assert it.
#
# Narrates, step by step, that a client reaches a PRIVATE origin (bound to
# 127.0.0.1, unreachable from outside) ONLY through the tunnel, over the central
# edge, and reports the round-trip path (via=quic|tcp) and latency. Meant to be
# understandable by someone without Rust/CLI knowledge.
#
# Local (loopback) demo — no central host needed, builds its own edge+cert via
# the compose smoke path is out of scope here; this variant onboards against an
# already-running control plane + edge:
#   CENTRAL=<host> EDGE_CERT=/path/to/edge-cert.der ./scripts/demo.sh
#   ... CT_CLIENT_FORCE_TCP=1 ./scripts/demo.sh    # show the TCP fallback path
#   ... CT_CLIENT_ITERATIONS=50 ./scripts/demo.sh  # more samples for the latency read
#
# Prereqs: built binaries (BIN=./target/debug), socat, curl, jq.

# tunnel data path. (Logging inline in `socat SYSTEM:"…"` corrupted the echoed
# payload: socat wires the child's stdout AND stderr to the data channel, and the
# nested shell quoting leaked `[origin]` into the stream → `tunnel response
# mismatch`, #7 re-test. A handler script sidesteps both traps.)
