# HTTPS-through-the-tunnel demo (issue #22) — a REAL HTTPS website as the private
# origin, reached through the tunnel with the cert validated CLIENT-SIDE.
#
# Proves the v1 (Mesh Plane) claim: TLS terminates AT THE ORIGIN, not the edge.
# A self-signed HTTPS site is served on loopback; the agent bridges the tunnel to
# it (provider-blind, raw bytes); the client runs in forward mode so a normal
# `curl --cacert` speaks TLS end-to-end through the tunnel to the origin and gets
# a genuine HTTP 200. The edge only ever relays TLS-over-Noise ciphertext.
#
#   CENTRAL=<host-ip> EDGE_CERT=/path/to/edge-cert.der ./scripts/https-demo.sh
#
# Browser Plane (public hostname + Let's Encrypt over SNI) is deferred post-v1
# (ADR-0010) and out of scope here — this is the TLS-terminates-at-origin path.
#
# Prereqs: built binaries (BIN=./target/debug), openssl, curl, jq. CENTRAL must be an
# IP (the agent's CT_AGENT_EDGE needs a numeric socket address).
